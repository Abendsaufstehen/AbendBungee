**ZulfBungee - a bungeecord Skript addon!**

Inspired by Limeglass' work on Skungee, but custom coded for my network.
This plugin is currently *closed source* for now!

**Known Bugs:**

* Socket closed exception on the proxy side when the DataIn thread disconnects. Investigating.

**Supported Syntax:**

message bungeecord player %offlineplayers% [the message] %string% (effect)

[(all [[of] the]|the)] bungeecord players (expression)
