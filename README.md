# **ZulfBungee - a proxy Skript addon!**

*The project is currently based around Minecraft 1.12.2 and Java 8 to ensure a level of legacy support, but will be dropped soon.*

**Supports Bungeecord and Velocity!**

Small portions of this plugin were referenced from another addon to aid development ([Skungee by LimeGlass](https://github.com/Skungee/Skungee-2.0.0)), and code referenced will be credited accordingly.

Building this addon by yourself might be a bit of a pain right now, sorry! I am currently planning on switching from Maven to Gradle. For the meantime, you can load the repo as an IntelliJ project and you should be able to build it from there.

**Please keep in mind that this plugin is currently in Alpha testing, so serious bugs may occur!**

## **Known Bugs:**

* None right now!

# **Supported Syntax:**
